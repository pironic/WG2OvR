WG2OvR - WorldGuard 2 Overviewer Regions generation.
=============

![WG2OvR](http://i.imgur.com/DLD8W.jpg)

A simple php exporter of the WorldGuard regions formats into the Overviewer regions format. This script will generate visible isometric cubes on their Overviewer maps of where their WorldGaurd/WorldEdit regions are.

Updates are now being commited to https://github.com/pironic/Minecraft-Overviewer-Addons/tree/master/WG2OvR instead of this repo.

Requirements
-------

* [WorldEdit](http://www.sk89q.com/projects/worldedit/) -- Required by WorldGuard
* [WorldGuard](http://www.sk89q.com/projects/worldguard/) -- Define your regions with WorldGuard.
* [Overviewer](https://github.com/brownan/Minecraft-Overviewer) -- Map generation in the format of google maps, can be most forks of this project, but brownan's is typically the main project I support
* [PHP](http://php.net/) -- Your host/server must be able to parse the php language in order to support this script
* [spyc](http://code.google.com/p/spyc/) -- A Simple PHP YAML Class for reading WorldGuard version 5+ files. Comes included with this script (only required if you are using WG5).

Installation

### WorldGuard version 4-  `regions.txt`

    $file = file('<serverdir>\plugins\WorldGuard\regions.txt.old'); //regions.txt    
    $color_chestdeny = "#880000"; // what color should the region be when the flag chestaccess-deny is found?    
    $color_normal = "#FFAA00"; // what color should normal regions be colored as?
    
Reference the regions4.js.php in Overviewer by locating in your index.html (Default location for this is in the `web_assets` folder in your Overviewer directory). Replace the first line with the second line below.
